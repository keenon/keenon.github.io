                <p>
                    Welcome to the Biomechanics Energy Museum!
                    This is a collection of interactive 3D visualizations of biomechanical
                    energy during gait (under construction).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Why is visualizing energy useful?</b> Partly, because it's really pretty. But mostly, noticing
                    joints in the body where (kinetic and gravitational potential) energy is created (through positive
                    mechanical work, ultimately done by the muscles) and destroyed (through negative mechanical work),
                    we can get insights about how the body works. This can help with ideas for designing treatments for
                    gait disorders, or for designing exoskeletons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>How does this work?</b> You click on one of the links below, and you'll be taken to a page with a
                    3D visualization of the body. You can click and drag to rotate the view, and use the mouse wheel to
                    zoom in and out. There's playback speed in the lower right hand side. The particles each represent a
                    fixed quantum of energy, which is labeled in the top left
                    of the visualization. The particles you see travelling around the body all begin life as blue,
                    right after they are created by positive mechanical work at a joint, and then slowly turn red as
                    they travel through the body, until they are dissipated as heat with negative mechanical work at
                    another joint.
                    You can also mouse over bones at any time
                    to see how much total kinetic and potential energy is in
                    that bone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So without further ado, here are the visualizations:

                            <h3>Sprinting</h3>
                        </a> (my personal favorite)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="jogging_energy">
                            <h3>Jogging</h3>
                        </a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="walking_energy">
                            <h3>Walking</h3>
                        </a> (this subject was perturbed with external energy at the
                        pelvis part way through this trial -
                        can you tell when?)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <b>Note 1: This site is still very much a work in progress!</b> I intend to write documentation
                    about how
                    these visualizations were calculated, and what I see in them. For now, you'll have to satisfy
                    yourself with just playing with the visualizations themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Note 2: I will be at ASB.</b> Hello! Come find me at the conference and say hi! I'm presenting on
                    <a href="https://addbiomechanics.org/">AddBiomechanics</a> at the workshop on large-scale data
                    sharing on Tuesday.
