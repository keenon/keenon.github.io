                    Welcome to the Biomechanics Energy Museum!
                    This is a collection of interactive 3D visualizations of biomechanical
                    energy during gait (under construction).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Why is visualizing energy useful?</b> Partly, because it's really pretty. But mostly, noticing
                    joints in the body where (kinetic and gravitational potential) energy is created (through positive
                    mechanical work, ultimately done by the muscles) and destroyed (through negative mechanical work),
                    we can get insights about how the body works. This can help with ideas for designing treatments for
                    gait disorders, or for designing exoskeletons. Here's a <a
                        href="https://medium.com/@keenonwerling/thoughts-on-physical-energy-gait-and-exoskeletons-afc8a7c59e9f">short
                        blog post</a> about some of the ideas these energy visualization have inspired for me for
                    exoskeleton designs.
                    I hope it inspires you too!
                </p>

                    <b>How does this work?</b> You click on one of the links below, and you'll be taken to a page with a
                    3D visualization of the body. You can click and drag to rotate the view, and use the mouse wheel to
                    zoom in and out. There's playback speed in the lower right hand side. The particles each represent a
                    fixed quantum of energy, which is labeled in the top left
                    of the visualization. The particles you see travelling around the body all begin life as red,
                    right after they are created by positive mechanical work at a joint, and then slowly turn blue as
                    they travel through the body, until they are dissipated (as heat) with negative mechanical work at
                    another joint.
                    Bones are color coded according to the energy density in that segment (J/kg).
                    You can also mouse over bones at any time
                    to see how much total kinetic and potential energy is in
                    that bone.
                    There are red spheres at the joints to indicate when potential energy may be being stored (probably
                    in tendons).
                    These are computed on a upper bound estimate, where we assume <i>all</i> negative work that is
                    followed by
                    positive work at a joint is stored as potential (spring) energy, rather than done by muscles.
                </p>
                <!-- <p>
                    <b>Mobile users:</b> It should work, but there are more features on a real computer. I'd be
                    flattered if you tried it on your computer.
                </p> -->
                <p>
                    So without further ado, here are the visualizations (fair warning for mobile users - these use a
                    bunch of data to view):

                        pelvis part way through this trial -
                        can you tell when?)

                    about how
                    these visualizations were calculated, and what I see in them. For now, you'll have to satisfy
                    yourself with just playing with the visualizations themselves.
