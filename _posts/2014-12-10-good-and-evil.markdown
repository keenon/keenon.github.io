SPOILER ALERT: If you haven't watched Season 1 of Game of Thrones, there's a fairly substantial spoiler in here

There are two TV shows I'd recommend you see: *Game of Thrones*, and *House of Cards*. If nothing else they say a lot about the American psyche.

In both shows (which are both smash-hit successes), protaganists with hopelessly skewed moral complexes get what they want (which is always Power, with a capital P) by manipulating, lying, and cheating. We call this "realism," and we love it. When a character in Game of Thrones flippantly says "Lord Stark was an honorable man, and Lord Stark died," all of us watching at home nod in agreement. This is reality, we say. It's nasty, people cheat to get what they want, and if you want to get ahead, you have to play dirty. If you're too honorable and kind, you'll never make it.

Pay special attention to that last sentence. If you didn't make it, maybe it's because you *were too honorable and kind.* The hyper-cynical world-view we love to watch on TV has a strangely comforting upshot: those who lose in competition with others are endowed with moral virtue. It's an ingenious way to reconcile the tautological fact that only 1% of the population can be in the top 1%, and Walt Disney telling you that you can be anything you want to be. Maybe that 1% are a bunch of sons-of-bitches, and the rest of us 99% are really just honorable souls who could've made it to the top, but would rather be kind to people.

There may be some truth to it, and it certainly does comfort many, but I'm uncomfortable with the conclusions that really ambitious kids draw from this ethic that's floating around.

*You don't have to be a Sadist to get ahead.* In fact, people won't work with a back-stabber, and if nobody will work with you, you'll never take over Poland, no matter how hard you try. Don't let me ruin your enjoyment, but take your TV with a grain of salt. It's just a darker kind of Fairy Tale, and no less fanciful for being more brutal.

Cheers,
