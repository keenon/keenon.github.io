I'm venturing out into the world to found a company as I graduate from Stanford. I've decided that documenting what I learn out in the world will be much more interesting to the denizens of the internet than the dusty old posts that used to clutter up this blog, so I'm starting over.

From here on out, my target audience is myself from 6 months ago. Basically, someone who is excited about becoming an entrepreneur, has some marketable technical skills, but doesn't have a clue about how to sell, raise money, or run a company.

Hopefully by writing this blog I can help people avoid my mistakes I make as I make them. I also hope it will serve as a useful place I can refer people to when I get asked questions about the startup process. Mostly, this is really just something I wish I had had access to starting out, so I'm trying to create it for the next generation.
