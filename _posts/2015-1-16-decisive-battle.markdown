Throughout history, through almost all cultures, the concept of the "decisive battle" has been a powerful story-telling device for understanding the complexities of war. It's easy to paint, write songs about, and prepare for.

The trouble with decisive battle is that in order for it to take place, both sides must be seeking it. Armies need to deliberately face off and smash one another to bits on a single plane. The famous names like Canne, Waterloo, and Gettysburg are all the result of a mutually consensual decisive battle. After the battle, peace is restored either by the wholesale slaughter of the losing side, as at Canne, or by the "honorable surrender" of the leader, as at Gettysburg.

In an oversimplification, we could say that military units with relatively low morale have no choice but decisive battle. Napoleon observed that in poorly led military units, many men fall ill and ask to be left behind, while in well led military units, nobody does.

Once the combatants realize that decisive battle is consensual, however, the weaker side can simply refuse to cooperate.
