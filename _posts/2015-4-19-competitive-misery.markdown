In Korea, it is possible to be a professional video-gamer. For several popular games, among them StarcraftII, televised big budget tournaments are a regular part of life. People actually sit in bars and watch other people play video games through the television. The tournaments generate real advertising revenue, which means that it is possible to pay players a living wage to spend every waking moment honing their skills. They live in special team houses, and have all their needs provided for by team managers. Rise, work out, then the day is spent practicing. The elite players are able to make roughly 120 strategic inputs to the computer per minute (around 2 per second), in a game far more complicated than chess, Starcraft II. We'll return to this phenomenon, but first, a story.

Back in highschool, I bought myself a copy of Starcraft II. I jumped into competitive online play. The system for playing online would match you with someone of equivalent skill level in a few seconds, and you could launch into immediately gratifying extravaganzas of strategically orchestrated mass killings of small virtual lizards.

The pure enjoyment of the game lasted about 2 days. Then I was demoted a league, and my competitive instincts kicked in. You see, the online Starcraft II world is stratified by leagues, labeled by precious materials: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond (Diamond is where the Korean pros play). I started out placed into the Silver league, and after I lost a few matched in a row, I was politely told by my machine that I would henceforward be competing in the Bronze league.

This, naturally, prodded my sensitive ego, which in turn awoke my competitive fury. I began to take my Starcraft II more seriously. Deadly seriously, in fact. The Bronze league didn't stand a chance against my Katana sharp focus. I would devote several hours a day after school to honing my clicking rate, memorizing strategic combinations, and watching recordings of Diamond level games on YouTube.

Before we reach the culmination of our little tragedy, I'd like to make a brief digression into academic literature. Usually, psych papers can be safely ignored, and ought to be. However, "The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance" (Ericsson et al, '93) is a *seriously useful* psych paper, and is to be ignored at your peril. This is the guy who proposed the "10,000 hours to become an expert" idea that Malcolm Gladwell has so profitably popularized.

To save you the long read, the paper studies professional, world-class athletes and musicians. In particular, the claim is that reaching their levels of performance requires spending time on "deliberate practice." As it's described in the paper, "deliberate practice" is time spent on a secondary activity specifically designed to improve the primary activity (ie doing drills to improve your Basketball shooting). The paper further states that during deliberate practice the subject cannot be in "flow state," which in effect means that what the subject is doing must be too hard to be fun.

So, my high-school self, having been insulted by a drop to Bronze league, began to engage in "deliberate practice." I didn't enjoy what I was doing, but I knew that it was necessary to win, and I was willing to do whatever was necessary to win. This continued for about a year, and I clawed my way up to the Gold league, thoroughly hating every minute of the stressful games and exhausting practice, before I began to ask the overdue existential question: "why am I playing Starcraft II?"

The Starcraft II ladder system has a remarkable propery for a video-game: it will always be able to produce a player who is more dedicated to the game than you, unless you are willing to drop everything and take up the monastic life of a professional gamer living in a house in South Korea, and even then it's not a sure thing. I can promise you that the life of a professional gamer, much like a professional athlete or musician, is full of "deliberate practice," which means that it's awefully short on genuine life enjoyment. Life is about painful work, in order to prepare for stressful competition, in the hope of eventually winning.

This, I think, is a general property of competitive systems, ranging from athletics to engineering. At the end of the day, performance is a function of raw ability and pain tolerance. Others will continue to push to limits of their pain tolerance in an attempt to beat you, forcing you to endure more pain in order to remain ahead. This means that any activity you "play to win" will necessarily become extremely painful, unless it's not worth winning (in which case you may have no competition), or you have truly extraordinary natural ability (where you're an order of magnitude better than the next currently living human, which you're certainly not).

So the moral of the story is to pick your battles very carefully: if you're going to play to win, make sure that winning is worth enormous pain, because that is certainly what it is going to take. Of course, a perfectly reasonable answer is to decide that nothing is worth the requisite pain to be world-class. I find that conclusion somehow diffusely aweful, but I can't put my finger on why, so I won't try to talk you out of it. For me, I'm devoting all my pain-tolerance to become an excellent AI researcher.

Cheers,
Keenon
