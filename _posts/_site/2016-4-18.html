<p>In business, I’ve noticed that the biggest design pattern seems to be the “funnel,” so I thought I would write a quick post about it.</p>

<p>A business “funnel” is any process where you lose items as they progress through your system. For example: sales. In sales, your “sales funnel” turns email addresses into meetings (and loses 95% of them in the process), then turns meetings into sales (and loses another 50%). Your “hiring funnel” works in a similar way (find candidates on LinkedIn, turn those into initial meetings, turn those into interviews, turn those into offers, bargain those into final paperwork). If you’re raising money, you’ll also have a “fundraising funnel” (which turns VCs into meetings, meetings into terms sheets, then terms sheets into money in the bank).</p>

<p>Everything that involves getting people to change their behavior (buy from you, work for you, give you money) will involve people saying “no” at every step of the process, and so is helpful to think of as a funnel.</p>

<p>What’s really interesting (to my engineering brain anyways) is the organizational clarity that thinking of business processes as a “funnel” gives you. We use Trello to keep a board for each funnel our business is operating, and have a column for each stage of your pipeline. We put a card on the board for each person traversing the pipeline, with any notes we need. It’s been very helpful (and sometimes surprising) to see how many cards are in each stage of each funnel. It’s much easier to manage what you can see.</p>
