<p>Sales is the life blood of a startup in using a B2B (“business to business”) model. If you don’t have money coming in from sales, you have to raise money from VCs instead (read “sell your soul,” if they’ll even buy it). You really really want to have sales.</p>

<p>So how does one get sales? In one word: questions. Ask lots and lots of them. Listen carefully to how people respond. Don’t pitch, brainstorm solutions to problems with your potential customer. You’re a consultant, who happens to also be in the business of solving this particular problem.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-google-for-help">How to Google for help</h3>

<p>Let’s start with what Google words to use: “sales leads” are basically just email addresses tied to some position at a company (CTO, VP of X, etc) that might want to buy your product. You can buy lists of leads online through lots of services (Google “buy leads”, and be shocked by the number of paid listings). “Prospecting” is the process of sending cold emails to your leads to see who will give you a phone call or a meeting. A “sales methodology” is a system for what to do once you get the meeting/phone call, that will help get you to a “close” (somebody writing you a check, which is the whole point).</p>

<p>Practicing sales is nothing like learning to code. You need to have something to sell, and somebody to sell it to. It’s embarrassing to mess up, and it’s hard to recover and try again with the same person.</p>

<p>This makes it really hard to learn for us engineers. One way (for the very determined) is to join a startup, and see if you can convince them to let you go make sales calls (not as your day job, which should still be code, just occasionally to help you learn). If you’re incredibly adventurous, and have a reasonable back-up plan, you could even try to start your own company and build something people want to buy.</p>
