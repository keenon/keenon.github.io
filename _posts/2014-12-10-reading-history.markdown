I finished reading *The Invisible Bridge: The Fall of Nixon and Rise of Reagan* by Rick Pearlstein a few weeks ago. It was an exceptionally partisan and generally untrustworthy account of recent history, but it contains an interesting throughline. To hear him tell it, once upon a time (in that great righteous WW2 blah blah blah), we were all patriotic, and the Presidency of the United States of America meant something. We won a wholly morally justified war against the Nazis, and with it an American Peace. We were the greatest nation on Earth, and we knew it. Then came Vietnam, and Watergate, and our dreams came tumbling down. Nixon was a monster and a criminal, and Americans didn't believe in America anymore. The book goes on to argue that Reagan went about pulling wool back over American's eyes, and that he postponed a still pending American "growing up".

Full disclosure: I vote Democratic. Even so, it's hard to trust a book that leans so far left that it talks about Senate subcommitties being "larded by Republicans." But the argument of the book aside, you often learn the most by examining the choice of "moral of the story" that history books are trying to validate, not their actual arguments, which come in the form of the main narrative. This book seems to be taking notice of a wave of cynicism in America (on this we agree). It would like us to assume with it that defeat in Vietnam was the inevitable fate for an irresonsible and immature superpower (probably also true). It would also like us to believe that a national "growing up" is possible only if Americans become more cynical (more dubious). I'm not completely sure about any of those claims, but aren't they terribly interesting? Much more so than a discussion of Reagan's early years as a lifeguard and radio announcer, which occupy a bulk of the pages.

Cheers,
