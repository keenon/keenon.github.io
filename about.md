Hi, I'm Keenon Werling, a Junior studying Computer Science at Stanford. This is where I keep all the ideas that are too hard to explain in a passing conversation, but that I'm still interested with telling somebody about. Topics vary from Natural Language Processing (my research concentration of over a year now), Silicon Valley, History, Culture, Machine Learnin, and anything else that I find time to type up.

My current article TODO list:

* Real-Valued Multi-Armed Bandit Optimization
* Overselling and underselling AI in Silicon Valley
* Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
* An Introduction of Natural Language Processing (no, we're not just building a better Siri)
