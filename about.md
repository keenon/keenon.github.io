Hi, I'm Keenon Werling.

I've been working on research and infrastructure in our Artificial Intelligence lab at Stanford for the last few years.
My research has focused on how to get computers and humans to cooperate most effectively.

I'm off starting a company with my good friend Gabor Angeli called Eloquent Labs. This blog is where I record my lessons learned out in the startup world. My goal is to create the blog that I wish I had found 6 months ago when I was just starting out.
