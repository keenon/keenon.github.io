  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Imagine a tribe of hunter-gatherers living in the Great Plains of the American midwest, around year 1700. Buffallo are plentiful, and are the tribe’s primary source of food. A small number of tribe members manage the huts and everyday administration of the tribe, but the majority of the tribe’s members are hunters. Upon killing a buffallo, the individual responsible for throwing the spear that killed the buffallo is given tremendous glory, access to the best hut, and first pick on buffallo meat.</p>

<p>In this tribe, hunters work alone, because the credits for buffallo-kill-assists are marginal at best. An assist, while helping the tribe overall, will yield the individual no hut, and hardly any glory. The chieftan of the tribe doesn’t know where fat buffallo may be hiding, and so she sends hunters off in every direction, to hedge against the failure of any one hunting expedition. If all the hunting expeditions fail for too many weeks in a row, stores will run low, and the tribe will starve.</p>

<p>Substitue buffallo for papers, and we’ve got a reasonably accurate view of the academic working group in computer science.</p>

<p>There’s a reason I chose such a primitive social structure to compare a lab to. I think we’re missing a fundamental cooperative “technology” to allow fruitful academic cooperation across individuals in order to tackle large scientific problems, and it’s within reach. In order to get there, though, we need to first understand where we are.</p>

<p>Incentives in academia:</p>

<p>It’s easy to see why the incentives for all the individuals in this scenario make it a stable point. A chieftan who moves all of the hunters into cooperating on a single hunt has trouble deciding how to allocate limited quality huts to a large successful group, and runs the risk of failure of all hunters during an expedition. It’s much safer to hedge and disperse. It also doesn’t make sense for hunters to unilaterally cooperate, except under very limited circumstances, because the gains from coopration are unclear and the rewards are given to a single individual.</p>
