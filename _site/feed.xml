        <title>On funnels</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In business, I’ve noticed that the biggest design pattern seems to be the “funnel,” so I thought I would write a quick post about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A business “funnel” is any process where you lose items as they progress through your system. For example: sales. In sales, your “sales funnel” turns email addresses into meetings (and loses 95% of them in the process), then turns meetings into sales (and loses another 50%). Your “hiring funnel” works in a similar way (find candidates on LinkedIn, turn those into initial meetings, turn those into interviews, turn those into offers, bargain those into final paperwork). If you’re raising money, you’ll also have a “fundraising funnel” (which turns VCs into meetings, meetings into terms sheets, then terms sheets into money in the bank).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything that involves getting people to change their behavior (buy from you, work for you, give you money) will involve people saying “no” at every step of the process, and so is helpful to think of as a funnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s really interesting (to my engineering brain anyways) is the organizational clarity that thinking of business processes as a “funnel” gives you. We use Trello to keep a board for each funnel our business is operating, and have a column for each stage of your pipeline. We put a card on the board for each person traversing the pipeline, with any notes we need. It’s been very helpful (and sometimes surprising) to see how many cards are in each stage of each funnel. It’s much easier to manage what you can see.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On learning to sell (anything) in Silicon Valley</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sales is the life blood of a startup in using a B2B (“business to business”) model. If you don’t have money coming in from sales, you have to raise money from VCs instead (read “sell your soul,” if they’ll even buy it). You really really want to have sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does one get sales? In one word: questions. Ask lots and lots of them. Listen carefully to how people respond. Don’t pitch, brainstorm solutions to problems with your potential customer. You’re a consultant, who happens to also be in the business of solving this particular problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-google-for-help&quot;&gt;How to Google for help&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with what Google words to use: “sales leads” are basically just email addresses tied to some position at a company (CTO, VP of X, etc) that might want to buy your product. You can buy lists of leads online through lots of services (Google “buy leads”, and be shocked by the number of paid listings). “Prospecting” is the process of sending cold emails to your leads to see who will give you a phone call or a meeting. A “sales methodology” is a system for what to do once you get the meeting/phone call, that will help get you to a “close” (somebody writing you a check, which is the whole point).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resources-to-start-with&quot;&gt;Resources to start with&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some excellent resources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kris Duggan talking about sales for an hour: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKVsEENwHYs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An excellent book: “You can’t teach a kid to ride a bike at a seminar”, by David H. Sandler&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Really serious? Start a company and join an incubator like Alchemist (http://alchemistaccelerator.com/) and get personal coaching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;practicing-in-the-wild&quot;&gt;Practicing in the wild&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practicing sales is nothing like learning to code. You need to have something to sell, and somebody to sell it to. It’s embarrassing to mess up, and it’s hard to recover and try again with the same person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes it really hard to learn for us engineers. One way (for the very determined) is to join a startup, and see if you can convince them to let you go make sales calls (not as your day job, which should still be code, just occasionally to help you learn). If you’re incredibly adventurous, and have a reasonable back-up plan, you could even try to start your own company and build something people want to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Keenon restarts his blog</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m venturing out into the world to found a company as I graduate from Stanford. I’ve decided that documenting what I learn out in the world will be much more interesting to the denizens of the internet than the dusty old posts that used to clutter up this blog, so I’m starting over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here on out, my target audience is myself from 6 months ago. Basically, someone who is excited about becoming an entrepreneur, has some marketable technical skills, but doesn’t have a clue about how to sell, raise money, or run a company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully by writing this blog I can help people avoid my mistakes I make as I make them. I also hope it will serve as a useful place I can refer people to when I get asked questions about the startup process. Mostly, this is really just something I wish I had had access to starting out, so I’m trying to create it for the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;
